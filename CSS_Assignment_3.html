       <h1><u>Super Mom</u></h1>
        Mom, you're a wonderful mother,
        So gentle, yet so strong.
        The many ways you show you care
        Always make me feel I belong.
        
        You're patient when I'm foolish;
        You give guidance when I ask;
        It seems you can do most anything;
        You're the master of every task.
        
        You're a dependable source of comfort;
        You're my cushion when I fall.
        You help in times of trouble;
        You support me whenever I call.
        
        I love you more than you know;
        You have my total respect.
        If I had my choice of mothers,
        You'd be the one I'd select!
